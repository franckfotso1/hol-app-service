[Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/) is a service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends. It offers autoscaling, automated management, and security for your various applications running in Windows or Linux environments.

**Why AppService?**

It is a fully managed platform as a service (**PaaS**) service for developers offering some these key features:

- **Multiple languages and frameworks**: Offers support for .NET, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python.
- **Global scale with high availability**: Scale up or out manually or automatically.
- **Managed production environment**: updates the OS, the frameworks and allows you to focus on the application code.
- **Containerization**: package your application and host a Windows or Linux container. Use Docker Compose for a multi-container application.
- **DevOps**: Set up continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, etc .
- **Security and Compliance**: Authenticate users with Azure AD, Google, Facebook, Twitter or even a Microsoft account. App Service is ISO, SOC compliant.
- **Connection to Saas platforms**: connect to your business systems such as SAP, Salesforce, etc.
- **App Templates**: Take advantage of a comprehensive list of app templates on Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress.

Azure offers other services that can be used for hosting web sites and applications. For most scenarios, App Service is the best choice. If you need more control over the virtual machines running your applications, use [Azure Virtual Machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) instead. For a microservices architecture, orient yourself towards [Azure Spring Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/), [Service Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/), or [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/).

With App Service, you pay for the Azure compute resources which are determined by the **App Service plan** your apps are running on.
